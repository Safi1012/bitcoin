## Getting started

The *Bitcoin iOS App* was created with the open source programming language Swift 4.0. The application supports all iPhone devices running iOS 11.0 and later. The following list explains all steps needed to execute the Bitcoin app on your Mac machine / iOS device.


1.  **Xcode 9** <br/>
Because *Bitcoin* was written in Swift 4.0, you need to install the Xcode 9.0 beta version. You can find a copy of the Xcode 9.0 beta on the Apple's Developer website: [https://developer.apple.com/download](https://developer.apple.com/download)


2. **Cocoapods** <br/>
Cocoapods (dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects) was used in this project to obtain and install additional libraries. Please make sure you have Cocoapods installed on your system in order to fetch and install the projects dependencies. See the Cocoapods site for more information: [https://cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org)<br/><br/>
To install all dependencies that this app has just execute the following command in your command line: ```$pod install```


3. **Execute the app** <br/> 
Open the Bitcoin ```bitcoin.xcworkspace``` file with Xcode 9.0 and press the *Run* (triangle) button. Have fun!

## Documentation

The code documentation can be found in the ```/docs``` folder and can be viewed on any browser by opening the ```index.html``` file.

## Future improvements

The app could be improved in the near future with the following features.

1. **Offline support** <br/>
Make the fetched data offline available. The app would be able to show data when on places where no internet connection is available.

2. **Landscape support** <br/>
The line chart could be presented in full screen mode as soon as the user rotates his device to landscape.

3. **More filters** <br/>
Add additional filters such as 1Y and 5Y to display the historical Bitcoin data.

3. **Multiple Currencies** <br/>
Add support for multiple currencies. At the moment the app only supports US Dollar.
